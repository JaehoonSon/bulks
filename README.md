# BULKS — README

## Overview

BULKS is a platform that generates TikTok and Instagram Reels at scale to help startups, app developers, and B2C companies market their products or apps. It automates short-form video creation using AI to produce consistent, relatable content that lightly features the product through captions and text rather than heavy visuals.

## Core Idea

More views lead to stronger growth. BULKS uses AI to create high-volume, engaging videos that boost visibility, drive conversions, and strengthen brand presence through social platforms.

## Key Features

- **AI-Generated Reels** — Automatic TikTok and Instagram video creation.
- **Business Context Setup** — Define your brand type, audience, and tone before generating content.
- **Style Selection** — Choose from multiple creative and trend-based formats.
- **Carousel & Video Marketing Hub** — Manage, preview, and publish campaigns.
- **Scalable Output** — Produce dozens or hundreds of social videos in a single workflow.

## Intended Users

- App developers seeking user growth
- Startups needing fast, consistent content
- B2C companies without large creative teams
- Marketers and creators testing social strategies

## Why It's Innovative

High-volume short-form content production was not scalable before AI. BULKS removes manual bottlenecks by generating ideas, scripts, and visuals automatically, making ongoing content marketing achievable for small or lean teams.

## Workflow

1. Define business context.
2. Select content style and format.
3. Generate AI-powered videos.
4. Review and publish to TikTok or Instagram.

## Philosophy

Relatable, frequent content converts attention into growth. BULKS focuses on speed, scale, and relevance—helping brands stay visible without creative overhead.
